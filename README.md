# A-simple-chess-app
This is an Android app I developed for offline chess gameplay. The app supports both Player vs AI and Human vs Human modes, making it suitable for solo players or those who want to play with friends. The app doesn't require an internet connection and offers a smooth, intuitive user experience for playing chess anywhere, anytime.
